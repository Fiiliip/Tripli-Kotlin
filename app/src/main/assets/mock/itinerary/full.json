Despite the uprising being suppressed in late October 1944, Slovakia ultimately changed sides and ended the war on the side of the Allies.

Don´t walk the staircase to the church, but turn left to a tiny street going uphill. Walk the road. After 250m the road turns right and goes further uphill. After next 300m the heap will be on your right. Look for an obtrusive path to the right, going directly to heap. You can further follow the path, which is an educational trail and it will take you to the hills and forests above the village and then bring you back to the village and car park. The whole walk takes around 60-90 minutes.",

This church does not stand in its original location, a fact that may have caused it to lose a place on the UNESCO World Heritage List. In 1974, the village of Paludza was inundated and destroyed during the construction of the Liptovska Mara water reservoir and the huge church, which has an estimated capacity of 4000 people, was disassembled and moved to its present site. It contains a baroque wooden altar from 1693, as well as a wooden pulpit, a Venetian glass chandelier and an impressive vault. The church is still used for religious services as well as occasional concerts.",

It´s a pilgrimage site. \n\nThe world famous pilgrimage site Marianska Hill overlooks the town. Villagers built the church in gratitude to the virgin Mary for saving their lives as they hid behind the hill undiscovered while evading the Tartars, who invaded the area in the 13th century. Though it is open all year, the site sees the most action on the first Sunday in July. Pope John Paul II designated the church a basilica in 1984, and when he visited 10 years later, nearly 650.000 of faithful flocked to Levoča to attend mass.",

There are lockers inside where you can leave your stuff and changing rooms to change your clothes. You will get a bracelet and lock the lockers with it. If you want to buy anything, you need to go to your locker and take the cash. There are several outdoor pools with various temperature of water. It varies from 26 till 38°C. The  water is geothermal, full of minerals and originally it has 62°C. They have to cool it down to use it. \n\nTips: \n\nDon´t stay in the hottest pool for too long, because you will be too tired quickly. Rather change the pools and go to colder pools as well. \n\nIf the temperature is too high during the day (more than 20°C), I don´t recommend to go there. Rather wait till the evening and arrive there later, when the temperature drops down. Your experience will be much better. In that case you should arrive there latest at 19:30. If you buy 2,5 hrs ticket, you can spend in the pools 2 hours till 21:30. At this time they let all the visitor go out of the pools and till 22:00 you should leave the place.",
