Exploring this structure offers the opportunity of understanding how mediaeval towns evolved. What had been the town church became the town castle and, with Gothic and Renaissance reconstructions, remained so until the late 18th century when the threat of Ottoman raids ceased. Visitors are welcomed to climb the tower and view the town and surrounding area.",
